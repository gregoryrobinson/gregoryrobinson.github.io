        <p>My name is Greg Robinson and I've been attending CSM via the distance education system for over two years. I have just about completed the Computer Science Applications Development AS degree program. I have designed a few web sites over the years mainly for fun and without a lot of formal training. After this course I also hope to take a class in mobile app development, focusing mainly on iOS development.</p>

    <div class="reasons">
        <p>I am attending this class because I have a desire to learn more about web development on a higher level. My main goal is to learn how to do something in a better, more efficient way and increase my knowledge of how web sites really work. I have a desire to delve deeper into the mobile areas as that is the trend for web browsing today. This should be a fun class and I hope to learn a lot of useful things.</p>

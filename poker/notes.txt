SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE

- Keep a cool, disinterested attitude. Don't bother arranging chips neatly

- Opponents act on a whim so don't just analyze what they should be doing, watch and listen for what they are doing

CHARTING THE TABLE

- Neatly dressed / orderly chip stack = good hand selection, seldom bluffs but can be bluffed, not likely to gamble

- Sloppily dressed / messy chip stack = plays loose, poised for action, don't try and bluff, feels like gambling

- Good luck charms or religious jewelry = plays too many pots, has lucky hands and goes for lucky draws, harder to bluff

- Players leaning back = not interested, being patient for good cards

- Players leaning forward = big time interest, likely a strong hand
